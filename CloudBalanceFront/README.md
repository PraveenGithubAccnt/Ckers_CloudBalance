🌥️ CloudBalance – FinOps Learning Platform

CloudBalance is a FinOps-based cloud management platform built using React + Vite, Java Spring Boot, and the AWS SDK. The application implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to provide secure access for Admin, Read-Only, and Customer users. 🔐

It includes dashboards for User Management, Onboarding, Cost Explorer, and AWS Services, allowing users to view both simulated and real-time cloud data. 📊⚡

Admins can manage users, onboard cloud accounts, and assign accounts to customers, while other roles have limited access. 👥💼

CloudBalance is designed for educational purposes to help users understand cloud costs, resource usage, and FinOps concepts in a simple and interactive way. 🎓🌐
