CloudBalance – FinOps Management Platform

CloudBalance is a FinOps-focused cloud management platform built for educational and learning purposes. It helps users understand cloud financial operations, usage tracking, and resource analytics through role-based dashboards.
The platform uses RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to ensure Admin, Read-Only, and Customer users only see the features permitted for their role.

CloudBalance includes operational dashboards for User Management, Onboarding, Cost Explorer, and Cloud Services, allowing users to explore both simulated and optionally mocked cloud data.
Admins can manage users, onboard cloud accounts, and assign customer views. Read-Only and Customer roles have restricted visibility for safe learning environments.

The project uses a modern stack including React + Vite, Java Spring Boot, and a simulated cloud data layer designed for FinOps learning.
